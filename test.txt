CICD Blue-Green Deployment is a strategy designed to reduce downtime and minimize risks during software 
updates. In this approach, two identical environments are maintained: one is 
the "Blue" environment, which serves the live production traffic, while the 
other is the "Green" environment, which hosts the new release. When 
deploying a new version, the release is deployed to the Green environment, 
which is completely separate from the current production system.
